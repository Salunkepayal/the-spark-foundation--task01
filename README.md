## Linear Regression Analysis of Study Hours vs Scores

This repository contains a simple linear regression analysis to predict student scores based on study hours. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset:-

The dataset used in this analysis consists of two columns:

Hours: The number of hours studied.

Scores: The corresponding scores obtained by students.

The dataset is sourced from this URL= "http://bit.ly/w-data"

## Setup:-

### Prerequisites-

To run this analysis, you'll need:

1)Python 

2)Jupyter Notebook 

## Analysis Steps:-

1)Load the Data: Read the dataset from the provided URL using pandas.

2)Explore the Data: Display the first few rows and check the data structure.

3)Train the Model: Use LinearRegression from scikit-learn to fit the model.

4)Make Predictions: Predict scores for new study hours (e.g., 9.25 hours).

5)Visualize the Results:

> Plot the data points.

> Plot the regression line.

> Plot the predicted score for new study hours.

6)Add Labels and Legend: Annotate the plot with appropriate labels and legends.

## Conclusion and Summary:-
This project demonstrates the application of simple linear regression to predict student scores based on study hours. The key steps include data loading, model training, making predictions, and visualizing the results. The predicted score for a student studying 9.25 hours per day is shown on the plot, along with the regression line and the original data points.

By following this analysis, we can conclude that there is a positive linear relationship between the number of hours studied and the scores obtained by students. This relationship can be effectively modeled using simple linear regression.
